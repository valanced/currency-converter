# Currency Converter CLI

Currency Converter CLI is a command-line utility that allows you to convert one currency into another. It is designed with a focus on extensibility and supports multiple data sources for exchange rates.

Currently, **CoinMarketCap API** is used as the only data source, but this field is configurable, and additional API providers can be integrated in the future.
